### Introduction ###

I want to write random stuff. 

Let's write some code. 

```{r}

a <- rnorm(100)
mean(a)

```

What if I just to display the code but not show the results/not run the code. 
I will set eval = FALSE (that is, evaluation is equal to false.)

```{r, eval=FALSE} 

b <- rnorm(1000)
mean(b)

```

What if I want to run the code and display the output, without showing the code.
This I perform by setting echo = FALSE

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

c <- rnorm(100)
mean(c)



```

Lastly, we will try visualizing some random plot. 


```{r}

plot(rnorm(1000))

```
