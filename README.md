# Data-Science
In this section, I am working with R for data visualization and analysis. I will be working different machine learning algorithm, statistics and more. 
I have pick a topic about livestock of 75 districts of Nepal and a dataset of 75 districts livestock from open data on which I will perform Data Analysis, Visualization, Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning throughout the semester as my assignment. 

In previous semester (2nd semester) module programming for data analysis, I have learn python for data analysis and visualization using python's inbuilt package like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Beautiful summary report based on the data analysis was presented as assignmnet in this module. 

I will be more talking about the data science in this repository.
